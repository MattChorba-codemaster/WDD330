    <h1>Objects</h1>
    <h2>Object literals</h2>
    <p>
      Objects map to any JavaScript value such as strings, numbers, booleans,
      arrays and functions. If a property’s value is a function, it is known as
      a method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects can be created two ways: const myVar = {} (object literal) or
      const myVar = new Object() (constructor function)
    </p>
    <p>See console for code examples.</p>

        <h3>Ch 2</h3>
        <li>‘let’ vs ‘var’ — var is still supported (JS is backwards compatible)</li>
        
        
        
        <li>‘let’ and ‘const’ have block scope when declared inside a block ( global otherwise)</li>
        
        
        
        <li>The biggest number that JavaScript can handle is (+/-)1.7976931348623157e+308: more makes ‘Infinity’ error</li>
        
        
        
        <li>** is for exponents</li>
        
        
        
        <h3>Ch 3</h3>
        
        
        
        <li>Destructuring an array is the concept of taking values out of an array and presenting them as individual values</li>
        
        
        
       <li> Numbers are also sorted alphabetically (that is, by their first digit, rather than numerically), so 9 will come after 10 when you try to sort an array of numbers: use a callback with sort to fix this</li>
        
        
        
        <li>Maps were another data structure introduced in the ES6 specification. They are a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, and are similar to 'hashes', or 'hash tables' or 'dictionaries' in other programming languages.
        
        
        
            Ternary Operator
           
           A shorthand way of writing an if ... else statement is to use the ternary operator, ?, which takes three operands</li>
        
        
        
        <h3>Ch 4</h3>
        
        
        
        <li>Every Function Has a Name
        
            All functions have a read-only property called name, which can be accessed like so:
            
            
            
            << 'hello'</li>
        
        <li>The name property is not actually part of the ECMAScript standard, although most JavaScript engines support it and use it internally.
        
            Anonymous functions have an empty string as their name property in most browsers, although some versions of Internet Explorer use undefined.
            
            The name property can be useful when debugging code, as the name of a function will be used to indicate which functions are causing a problem.</li>
        
        
        
        <li> Don’t Repeat Yourself, (Links to an external site.) or DRY, is a principle of programming that specifies that every part of a program should only be written once. This avoids duplication and means there’s no need to keep multiple pieces of code up to date and in sync.</li>
        
        
        
        <li>Everything that isn’t a primitive data type in JavaScript is an object</li>
